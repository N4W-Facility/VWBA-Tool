# VWBA-Tool
The VWBA Tool v1.0 emerges as a solution to operationalize the methods consolidated in the Volumetric Water Benefit Accounting (VWBA) guide. This tool allows decision-makers and technicians of watershed investment programs to quickly estimate the volumetric benefits generated by nature-based solutions interventions in a watershed. The tool has been developed using the Matlab R2023b App Designer. Among the functionalities provided by the VWBA Tool are the estimation of volumetric benefits, TNC metrics, and areas of importance for biodiversity.
